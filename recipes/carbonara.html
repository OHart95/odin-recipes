      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente (usually 8-10 minutes depending on the type). Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until crispy and golden, about 5-7 minutes. If desired, you can add a small clove of garlic to the pan for flavor, then remove it once the pancetta/guanciale is done.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, Pecorino Romano, Parmesan, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. The mixture should be smooth and creamy. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked and drained, add the pasta directly to the skillet with the pancetta/guanciale, tossing to combine and coat the pasta in the rendered fat.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing vigorously to create a creamy sauce. Be sure to work quickly to prevent the eggs from scrambling.</li>
        <li>If the sauce appears too thick, gradually add a little of the reserved pasta water until the desired creamy consistency is achieved.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with more black pepper and, if necessary, a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, topped with extra grated cheese and black pepper, if desired.</li>
      </ol>
