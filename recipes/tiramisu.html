        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This Tiramisu recipe is a classic Italian dessert with layers of espresso-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy mascarpone filling.
            It's a rich, indulgent treat that's best when made ahead of time, allowing the flavors to develop and the dessert to set.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and granulated sugar until the mixture becomes pale and creamy.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the mascarpone cheese into the egg and sugar mixture until smooth. Then, fold in the whipped cream until fully incorporated, creating a light and airy cream mixture.</li>
            <li>In a shallow dish, combine the cooled espresso or coffee with the rum or Marsala wine (if using).</li>
            <li>Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture—don’t soak them, just dip them briefly—and arrange them in a single layer at the bottom of a serving dish or individual glasses.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture over the layer of soaked ladyfingers, smoothing it out evenly with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process by dipping the remaining ladyfingers into the coffee mixture and arranging them on top of the cream layer.</li>
            <li>Top with the remaining mascarpone cream mixture and smooth it out evenly.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate the tiramisu for at least 4 hours, or overnight if possible, to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder and garnish with chocolate shavings if desired.</li>
        </ol>
